# Kiwibot Delivery Service API

API developed by Angela Haydee Cobos as an exercise for Kiwibot.

## Technologies used:

- **NodeJS with Typescript**
- **Express**: API routes and middleware.
- **Firebase**: Database hosting.
- **Swagger**: API documentation.
- **Git**: Version control.

## How to run

1. Clone the Git repository.
2. Create a `.env` file on the root of the project. You can use the `example.env` file to see what environment variables are needed.
3. Run `npm run dev` to run the API locally with hot-reload, or `npm run build` to create a build of the project.

## API Docs

Once you have the project running, you can find the Swagger API docs under the `/api-docs` route.
